      La Operación Dinamo (en inglés: Operation Dynamo), también conocida como
      milagro de Dunkerque o evacuación de Dunkerque, fue una operación de
      evacuación de las tropas aliadas en territorio francés (después de que
      Francia fuera derrotada por el ejército alemán) durante la Segunda Guerra
      Mundial. Tuvo lugar en Dunkerque (Francia) a finales de mayo de 1940, y
      fue ideada, planificada y organizada por el almirante Bertram Home Ramsay
      y con apoyo del mariscal británico y comandante en jefe de la Fuerza
      Expedicionaria Británica (BEF), John Vereker Gort. La operación permitió
      rescatar a más de 200 000 soldados británicos y 100 000 franceses y
      belgas.

      El 26 de mayo a las 23:30 comenzó oficialmente la Operación Dinamo. Bajo
      un intenso fuego de artillería de las baterías alemanas y bombardeos de
      aparatos de la Luftwaffe, entre los que se encontraban los bombarderos en
      picado Stuka, miles de soldados británicos, franceses y belgas hacían
      colas en la playa, mientras siete divisiones francesas ofrecían
      resistencia en los ochenta kilómetros del frente.

      La Armada británica había preparado una flota con cuarenta destructores y
      ciento treinta barcos mercantes y de pasajeros, que debían embarcar las
      tropas en condiciones muy precarias, pues el puerto de Dunkerque había
      sido devastado por la Luftwaffe, y solo estaba practicable la zona
      exterior durante la marea alta. Para transportar a los soldados desde la
      playa hasta los barcos de la Royal Navy, que permanecían en alta mar
      defendiéndose de los bombardeos de la aviación alemana con sus propias
      baterías antiaéreas, se utilizaron todos los medios disponibles en la
      playa.

      Operation Desert Shield was a 2006 operation by the Iraqi insurgency and
      al-Qaeda in Iraq, planned in December 2005 as a push against American
      forces during the Iraq War. The goal was to destabilize the American
      foothold in the Anbar province over the course of six months. The planning
      of the operation was not discovered by the Americans until documents
      captured after the death of Faris Abu Azzam were finally translated, and
      revealed the details of the operation. The army said the documents
      surprised them, showing that the insurgents had a "pretty robust command
      and control system".

      The first phase, scheduled from January through March 2006, focused on
      isolating American targets by attacking supply convoys, destroying bridges
      and restricting the ability of helicopters to provide support. On 7
      January 2006, a two-page memo suggested that those insurgents who had
      infiltrated American bases be asked to reconnaissance the physical area
      and send back reports to help select potential targets. It also suggested
      that ammunition caches be placed in advance of the attacks, that only
      soldiers who had pledged their willingness to die in battle should be
      sent, and that they first be trained in a series of rehearsed mock
      battles. A later memo was drafted, which contained the names of the
      American bases that could potentially be assaulted – including a list of
      weapons each target would require, including explosives.

      Starting in March 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq began keeping reports of each
      attack against American troops, tracking casualties on both sides, and
      offering analysis of why attacks were or were not successful. Since
      al-Qaeda has no specific headquarters or "base" of operations, record
      keeping was never centralized and most information gathered by al-Qaeda
      operatives has been scattered across the Middle East and parts of Eastern
      Russia. However, the second phase of Operation Desert Shield led to more
      detailed reports and better training for future al-Qaeda soldiers.
      Currently, al-Qaeda recruits worldwide, with many new recruits coming from
      Western Europe, more commonly old Eastern Bloc nation states. New recruits
      receive a much more advanced level of training which includes but is not
      limited to topics such as: hand-to-hand combat, outdoor survival, advanced
      weapons systems, improvised munitions, night operations, risk and threat
      assessment, along with a 36-week history course on past skirmishes and
      battles that al-Qaeda has won or lost throughout its existence. The
      current al-Qaeda administration recognizes that the keen record keeping
      skills of Operation Desert Shield's Iraqi al-Qaeda command are to thank
      for the advanced training abilities that they are able to offer today

      Operation Pedro Pan (or Operación Pedro Pan) was a clandestine mass exodus
      of over 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban minors ages 1 to 18 to the United
      States over a two-year span from 1960 to 1962. They were sent by alarmed
      parents who heard rumors that Fidel Castro and the Communist party were
      planning to terminate parental rights and place minors in communist
      indoctrination centers, a real rule commonly referred to as the Patria
      Potestad hoax.The program consisted of two main components: the mass
      evacuation of Cuban children via airplane to the US – Miami as a
      particularly common hub – and the programs set up to care for them once
      they arrived. Both were led by Father Bryan O. Walsh of the Catholic
      Welfare Bureau. The operation was the largest mass exodus of minor
      refugees in the Western Hemisphere at the time. It operated covertly out
      of fear that it would be viewed as an anti-Castro political enterprise.

      Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the first wave of Cuban immigrants
      left for the United States. Most, if not all, thought it to be a temporary
      solution, imagining a life where they would return to Cuba once the United
      States liberated the country from both Fidel Castro and the spreading
      Communist movement. These were the most elite and well-off members of
      society: owners of big firms, big merchants, sugar mill owners,
      manufacturers, cattlemen, representatives of foreign companies and
      established professionals. They fled once their assets and property were
      seized by the new government

      By 1960 the Cuban government began reforming education strategies. School
      children were taught military drills, how to bear arms, and anti-American
      songs. By 1961 the Cuban government would seize control of all private
      schools. As a result of the new social order, rumors began to swirl,
      originating from both inside the United States and other anti-Castro
      media. Various outlets, including Miami's own Miami Herald and Time
      Magazine, reported that Castro and his followers intended to terminate
      parental rights, assume custody of all Cuban children, prohibit religion
      and indoctrinate them into communism. The CIA-backed Radio Swan station
      asserted that the Cuban government was planning to remove children from
      their parents and send them to the Soviet Union. Though all of these
      claims lacked evidence and the Cuban revolutionaries repeatedly denied all
      claims, the damage had already been done.

      Having been involved in a similar program that gained young Hungarians
      entrance to the US following Soviet repression of the 1956 uprising,
      Father Bryan O. Walsh of the Catholic Welfare Bureau, with the help of the
      U.S. government, developed the Cuban Children's Program in late 1960. Key
      players included Tracy Voorhees, Eisenhower Administration, James Baker
      and, of course, Father Walsh. By most accounts, the story is as follows:
      An October meeting brought the influx of Cuban refugees in Miami to the
      attention of the White House, with particular focus on what appeared to be
      a high number of unaccompanied minors wandering the city. Shortly after,
      Tracy Voorhees – a veteran U.S. government official who was serving as the
      president's Personal Representative for Cuban Refugees – reported that,
      though the issue was not large in number, it had still been highly
      publicized and, therefore, the administration needed to be seen taking
      action.

      Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra) is the code name given to a program of
      experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the
      U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which were illegal. Experiments on
      humans were intended to develop procedures and identify drugs such as LSD
      to be used in interrogations in order to weaken the individual and force
      confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture. The project
      was organized through the Office of Scientific Intelligence of the CIA and
      coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories.
      Other code names for drug-related experiments were Project Bluebird and
      Project Artichoke

      The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964
      and further curtailed in 1967. It was officially halted in 1973. The
      program also engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and
      Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy
      regarding its legitimacy.: 74 MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate
      its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the
      covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (especially LSD)
      and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation,
      isolation, and verbal and sexual abuse, in addition to other forms of
      torture.

      The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with activities carried out under
      the guise of research at more than 80 institutions, including colleges and
      universities, hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA
      operated using front organizations, although sometimes top officials at
      these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement. Project MKUltra
      was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of
      the United States Congress and Gerald Ford's United States President's
      Commission on CIA activities within the United States (also known as the
      Rockefeller Commission).

      Investigative efforts were hampered by CIA Director Richard Helms's order
      that all MKUltra files be destroyed in 1973; the Church Committee and
      Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of
      direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that
      survived Helms's destruction order. In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act
      request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra
      which led to Senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information
      regarding MKUltra was declassified in July 2001. In December 2018,
      declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor
      discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control
      and brain implants.
