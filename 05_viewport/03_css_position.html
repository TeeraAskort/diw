      According to author Stephen Kinzer, the CIA project "was a continuation of
      the work begun in WWII-era Japanese facilities and Nazi concentration
      camps on subduing and controlling human minds". Kinzer wrote that
      MKUltra's use of mescaline on unwitting subjects was a practice that Nazi
      doctors had begun in the Dachau concentration camp. Kinzer proposes
      evidence of the continuation of a Nazi agenda, citing the CIA's secret
      recruitment of Nazi torturers and vivisectionists to continue the
      experimentation on thousands of subjects, and Nazis brought to Fort
      Detrick, Maryland, to instruct CIA officers on the lethal uses of sarin
      gas.

      The project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA
      director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953. Its aim was to develop
      mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to
      alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind control techniques
      on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The CIA wanted to use
      similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating
      foreign leaders with such techniques, devising several schemes to drug
      Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects'
      knowledge or consent. In some cases, academic researchers were funded
      through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA
      was using their work for these purposes.

      The project attempted to produce a perfect truth drug for interrogating
      suspected Soviet spies during the Cold War, and to explore other
      possibilities of mind control. Subproject 54 was the Navy's top-secret
      "Perfect Concussion" program, which was supposed to use sub-aural
      frequency blasts to erase memory; the program was never carried out. Most
      MKUltra records were destroyed in 1973 by order of CIA director Richard
      Helms, so it has been difficult for investigators to gain a complete
      understanding of the more than 150 funded research subprojects sponsored
      by MKUltra and related CIA programs.

      The project began during a period of what English journalist Rupert
      Cornwell described as "paranoia" at the CIA, when the U.S. had lost its
      nuclear monopoly and fear of communism was at its height. CIA
      counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had
      penetrated the organization at the highest levels. The agency poured
      millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control
      the mind and to enhance its ability to extract information from resistant
      subjects during interrogation. Some historians assert that one goal of
      MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a "Manchurian
      Candidate"-style subject. American historian Alfred W. McCoy has claimed
      that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of
      "ridiculous" programs so that the public would not look at the research's
      primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation

      In 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA
      program. The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN
      and MKCHICKWIT. Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971.
      The project was a joint project between the U.S. Army Chemical Corps and
      the CIA's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use
      agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents. Its purpose was to develop,
      test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical,
      and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable
      human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly
      sensitive operational requirements. By March 1971 over 26,000 potential
      agents had been acquired for future screening. The CIA was interested in
      bird migration patterns for chemical and biological warfare (CBW)
      research; subproject 139 designated "Bird Disease Studies" at Penn State.
      MKOFTEN was to deal with testing and toxicological transmissivity and
      behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. MKCHICKWIT
      was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in
      Europe and Asia, and with acquiring samples.

      Early CIA efforts focused on LSD-25, which later came to dominate many of
      MKUltra's programs. The CIA wanted to know if they could make Soviet spies
      defect against their will and whether the Soviets could do the same to the
      CIA's own operatives. Once Project MKUltra got underway in April 1953,
      experiments included administering LSD to mental patients, prisoners, drug
      addicts, and sex workers – "people who could not fight back," as one
      agency officer put it. In one case, they administered LSD to a mental
      patient in Kentucky for 174 days. They also administered LSD to CIA
      employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, and
      members of the general public to study their reactions. LSD and other
      drugs were often administered without the subject's knowledge or informed
      consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code the U.S. had agreed to follow
      after World War II. The aim of this was to find drugs which would bring
      out deep confessions or wipe a subject's mind clean and program them as "a
      robot agent

      In Operation Midnight Climax, the CIA set up several brothels within
      agency safehouses in San Francisco to obtain a selection of men who would
      be too embarrassed to talk about the events. The men were dosed with LSD,
      the brothels were equipped with one-way mirrors, and the sessions were
      filmed for later viewing and study. In other experiments where people were
      given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright
      lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects
      they would extend their "trips" if they refused to reveal their secrets.
      The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military
      personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold
      War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this. Heroin
      addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin
    </div>

    <div>
      The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations, but Dr. Sidney
      Gottlieb, the chemist who directed MKUltra, had other ideas: he thought it
      could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he
      believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way
      affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized
      there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in
      clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was
      given to people in "normal" settings without warning. At first, everyone
      in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people
      in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the
      experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged
      with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of
      an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often
      occurred, such as an operative who received the drug in his morning
      coffee, became psychotic and ran across Washington, seeing a monster in
      every car passing him. The experiments continued even after Frank Olson,
      an army chemist who had never taken LSD, was covertly dosed by his CIA
      supervisor and nine days later plunged to his death from the window of a
      13th-story New York City hotel room, supposedly as a result of deep
      depression induced by the drug. According to Stephen Kinzer, Olson had
      approached his superiors some time earlier, doubting the morality of the
      project, and asked to resign from the CIA.

      Some subjects' participation was consensual, and in these cases they
      appeared to be singled out for even more extreme experiments. In one case,
      seven volunteers in Kentucky were given LSD for seventy-seven consecutive
      days. MKUltra's researchers later dismissed LSD as too unpredictable in
      its results. They gave up on the notion that LSD was "the secret that was
      going to unlock the universe," but it still had a place in the
      cloak-and-dagger arsenal. However, by 1962 the CIA and the army developed
      a series of super-hallucinogens such as the highly touted BZ, which was
      thought to hold greater promise as a mind control weapon. This resulted in
      the withdrawal of support by many academics and private researchers, and
      LSD research became less of a priority altogether

      The CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited British
      psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the "psychic driving"
      concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to
      correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the
      psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work
      at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000
      from 1957 to 1964 (which would be US$579,480 in 2021, adjusting for
      inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there, the Montreal
      experiments. These research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front
      organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as
      shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from
      the CIA.
    </div>
    <div>
      In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs
      as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal
      power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into
      drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case)
      while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His
      experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute
      for common problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression,
      many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions.: 140–150  His
      treatments resulted in victims' urinary incontinence, amnesia, forgetting
      how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators
      were their parents. During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the
      first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president
      of both the American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric
      Association. Cameron was also a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal
      in 1946–1947.: 141 
    </div>
    <div>
      His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William
      Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who
      was also involved in the Secret Intelligence Service and who experimented
      on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.
      In the 1980s, several of Cameron's former patients sued the CIA for
      damages, which the Canadian news program The Fifth Estate documented.
      Their experiences and lawsuit was made into a 1998 television miniseries
      called The Sleep Room. Naomi Klein argues in her book The Shock Doctrine
      that Cameron's research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was
      not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing "a
      scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant
      sources'. In other words, torture."
