        The project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953.
        Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged Soviet,
        Chinese,
        and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The CIA wanted
        to
        use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with such
        techniques,
        devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects' knowledge or
        consent. In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were
        unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.

        The project began during a period of what English journalist Rupert Cornwell described as "paranoia" at the CIA,
        when
        the U.S. had lost its nuclear monopoly and fear of communism was at its height. CIA counter-intelligence chief
        James
        Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels. The agency poured
        millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control the mind and to enhance its ability to
        extract
        information from resistant subjects during interrogation. Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and
        related CIA projects was to create a "Manchurian Candidate"-style subject. American historian Alfred W. McCoy
        has
        claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of "ridiculous" programs so that the
        public would
        not look at the research's primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation.
