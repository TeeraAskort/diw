                    The project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on
                    April
                    13, 1953.
                    Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged
                    Soviet,
                    Chinese,
                    and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war during the Korean War. The
                    CIA
                    wanted
                    to
                    use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with
                    such
                    techniques,
                    devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro. It often conducted experiments without the subjects'
                    knowledge or
                    consent. In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations
                    but
                    were
                    unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.
